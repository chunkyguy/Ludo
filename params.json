I'm writing all the code from scratch*.\r\n\r\nI'll be using C*, the filenames are .m because I'm GLKMath library, which is again C based but for some reasons doesn't compiles well with plain C files.\r\n\r\nThe game is based on [popular game called Ludo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo_%28board_game%29). I'm not sure about the name, so for the time being lets call it Ludo.\r\nI'm hoping to make it online multiplayer, with computer AI.\r\nFor now, there are just 2 Cubes revolving around the center of the screen.\r\n\r\n* as much as possible.\r\n\r\n![Two cubes](http://i.imgur.com/ZBhLjVZ.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
