Ludo
====

iOS game.

What is?
--------
I've few free days, so I've decided to work on an Open Source game.

The game will target primarly iPad, could be moved to work for iPhone/iPod Touch later. The game will be written from 
as scratch as possible.

The game is a board game called Ludo (google it, if you haven't heard it). It is a 4 player game. I'm thinking of making
it multiplayer, turn based online via GameCenter. Also, the game should be be playable locally over multiple devices or
on same device. I'm not yet sure about the AI part, but since the AI should be very simple, I would add against 
computer at the end.

Who for?
--------
I'm expecting the audience to be budding game developers, or someone coming to iOS, or even someone learning turn based
gaming on iOS. I'm myself, learning things as I proceed, so I'm expecting many trial and errors and even entire code
refactoring at places.

I've no idea where I'll be posting updates. I started out at the github pages (http://chunkyguy.github.io/Ludo/) because of the Markdown format, but either
I've doing something wrong, but I feel updating the page needs it to be republished everytime I update. My ass doesn't
seems to ready for so much pain. So, I've decided to publish the upgrades at my regular blog: http://whackylabs.com/rants/?p=884

Quick updates I publish at my facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/whackylabs or at twitter: https://twitter.com/chunkyguy.
